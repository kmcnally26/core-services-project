PULP 2.4.0
=============
HDD 20GB 
Rebuild pulp can only be done from INET
Not with foreman
Its a chicken and egg.
Host must be built with correct fqdn and not altered after


PACKAGES AND REPOS
External for my setup:
Requires EPEL
Requires rhel-pulp

Get packages via inet as we cant add them to a pulp server thats not built yet:
yum -y install http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/ && wget http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo

Apache will be installed by the above

sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db - Itâ€™s important to do this before starting Apache
service httpd start && chkconfig httpd on

yum groupinstall pulp-admin -y
vi /etc/pulp/admin/admin.conf and set 
host = pulp.example.com
verify_ssl = False

Check hosts and resolve.conf files

pulp-admin login -u admin
Enter password: admin

Gets created once you login to pulp-admin ~/.pulp/user.pem
pulp-admin logout - will delete the file

OTHER
Downloader to manually add packages:
yum install yum-utils -y
yumdownloader puppet --resolve -y   without --resolve you only get the single rpm

RELATIVE PATHS FOR NEW REPOS
Copy what you see at centos eg
http://mirror.simwood.com/centos/7.0.1406/os/x86_64/

MY REPOS
All my repos have an external source
If baseurl is wrong you get an SSL nickname error. Nothing needed in yum.conf. 

[base-os-centos-x86_64]
name=Pulp Centos 6.5 DVD
baseurl=https://172.16.105.132/pulp/repos/centos/6/os/x86_64/Packages
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

[external-foreman]
name=Foreman 1.4
baseurl=https://172.16.105.132/pulp/repos/centos/6/external/foreman/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
sslverify=False

[external-centos-SCL]
name=CentOS 6 SCL
baseurl=https://172.16.105.132/pulp/repos/centos/6/external/SCL/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
sslverify=False

Foreman - releases and plugins repo
Puppet - releases and dependencies

Do you need EPEL for Foreman?
Not to install foreman only 3 packages needed from EPEL for foreman-proxy
rubygem-rack-1.1.0-2.el6.noarch.rpm
rubygem-rack-test-0.5.4-1.el6.noarch.rpm
rubygem-sinatra-1.0-2.el6.noarch.rpm

I have added all 3 to my external-foreman repo

KICKSTART REFS
Then ref in ks file so we can get puppet installed, this does not add .repo files to the OS:
repo --name=base-os-centos-x86_64 --baseurl=https://172.16.105.132/pulp/repos/centos/6/os/x86_64/Packages/ --noverifyssl


PULP ADMIN CLIENT
This can be on any host. Just yum groupinstall pulp-admin -y
Then add the pulp master hostname to the clients /etc/pulp/admin/admin.conf
No need for SSH keys (I think)
The certs for a client last 7 days by default



ERRORS
root@pulp:~$ pulp-admin login -u admin
Enter password: 
The web server reported an error trying to access the Pulp application. The
likely cause is that the pulp-manage-db script has not been run prior to
starting the server. More information can be found in Apache's error log file on
the server itself.
ssl_error_log
ConnectionFailure: could not connect to localhost:27017: [Errno -2]
sed -i 's/seeds: localhost/seeds: 127.0.0.1/' /etc/pulp/server.conf
service mongod restart
service httpd restart

$ /etc/init.d/mongod status
mongod dead but pid file exists
Could not start due to needed 4GB+ of disk space - see mongodb.log
Added the smallfiles: "true" to mongodb.conf
