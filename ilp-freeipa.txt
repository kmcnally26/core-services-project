SKIN FreeIPA IdM Identity Management
=========================================

Packages on DVD

INTERACTIVE INSTALL
ipa-server-install --no-ntp 

Details from the install:
The IPA Master Server will be configured with:
Hostname:      dns.example.com
IP address:    172.16.105.150
Domain name:   example.com
Realm name:    SKIN.EXAMPLE.COM

PW clontibret1

POST INSTALL
service sshd restart

Test its working:
$ kinit admin
Password for admin@SKIN.EXAMPLE.COM: 
$ ipa user-find admin


WEB UI
https://dns.example.com/ipa/ui/
admin / clontibret1

SHELL
IPA Server >> Configuration
Set to /bin/bash 

Set UID ranges
IPA Server >> ID Ranges 

HBAC
Also, by default, we are setting no HBAC (host based access control) rules, so no-one will be able to access the servers or clients

HOMEDIRS
Enable making home directory at log in:
authconfig --enablemkhomedir --update

CLIENT
ipa-client-install --domain example.com --server dns.example.com --mkhomedir --no-ssh --no-dns-sshfp --permit

User authorized to enroll computers: admin


This is important to do before you configure IPA, so that when users log in their home directory is made. Doing this after you've configured IPA on the box is a pain, so do it now before you

Setup complete

Next steps:
	1. You must make sure these network ports are open:
		TCP Ports:
		  * 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS
		  * 389, 636: LDAP/LDAPS
		  * 88, 464: kerberos
		UDP Ports:
		  * 88, 464: kerberos

	2. You can now obtain a kerberos ticket using the command: 'kinit admin'
	   This ticket will allow you to use the IPA tools (e.g., ipa user-add)
	   and the web user interface.
	3. Kerberos requires time synchronization between clients
	   and servers for correct operation. You should consider enabling ntpd.

Be sure to back up the CA certificate stored in /root/cacert.p12
This file is required to create replicas. The password for this
file is the Directory Manager password
