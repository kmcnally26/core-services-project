SKIN GIT
==============
So currently I have the master git repo for puppet on github

Most of the puppet work is done.

The work laptop is going to be used more from now on for SKIN work

So you cannot commit puppet changes without access to github
Which means clients wont get changes
Puppet runs will still work but no changes are applied unless you run to trunk


Pre github below


LOCAL GIT REPO ON PUPPET
The correct setup would be
git master repo
puppet master push/pull to git master
client pull only from git master
client does not interact with puppetmaster on git master
client does puppet runs with puppet apply locally
reports go to foreman


My setup so far

PUPPET COOKBOOK WAY?
This is similar to how it is setup in the puppet cookbook
Not exactly the same


MASTER CLONE
We are only cloning the env/ directory to /etc/puppet/
master git repo on puppet master at /var/git/env.git

WHERE TO EDIT PUPPET CODE
You only edit puppet code on the puppetmaster
Not on clients
Clients only PULL
Puppet master PUSH's changes to the master repo
Clients only get /etc/puppet/env/ from the repo
The rest of the local puppet config is normal.


GIT MASTER REPO 
Puppet master lets initialize env/
So far we have our puppet config:
ls /etc/puppet
auth.conf  env  fileserver.conf  foreman_enc.rb  manifests  puppet.conf

INITIALIZE THE SOURCE DIRECTORY
Initialize existing env/ dir:
cd /etc/puppet/env
git init
git add -A
git commit

CLONE SOURCE DIR TO MASTER REPO AT /VAR/GIT
clone to master repo which for us is on same host:
cd /var/git
git clone --bare /etc/puppet/env
Initialized empty Git repository in /var/git/env.git/
ls
env.git

You will have to remove /etc/puppet/env now and clone it from the new repo
This way you will be able to pull and push
cd /etc/puppet
mv env/ /opt/
git clone puppet:/var/git/env.git /etc/puppet/env



CLIENT SETUP
This is what the client needs to run
git clone puppet:/var/git/env.git /etc/puppet/env


The script
# Puppet Name: Git pull and Puppet apply
*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/papply


root@pulp:~$ cat /usr/local/bin/papply 
#!/bin/bash
# Pull git and do a puppet run locally, then send report
MY_ENV=/etc/puppet/env/prd
cd $MY_ENV
git pull
puppet apply  --modulepath=${MY_ENV}/modules ${MY_ENV}/manifests/site.pp
exit 0




Each client needs this added to puppet.conf
[main]
# This is for puppet apply to send reports to foreman
# Requires /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/reports/foreman.rb on the client
reports=log, foreman
